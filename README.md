# InfantAgent

## Introduction
1. To build a multimodal agent that can interact with its own PC in a multimodal manner. This means it can autonomously operate the mouse and click anywhere on the screen, rather than relying solely on browser analysis to make decisions.

2. This agent system will be used for subsequent reinforcement learning training of agents.

3. I have not yet conducted large-scale testing of this agent beyond the benchmark; please feel free to report any bugs or submit pull requests. :wave:

## Installation Requirements

Now, it is only tested on `linux` server with `Nvidia Tesla GPU (A100, H200 ...)`. There may be some bugs for Mac/Windows.

## Setup 

1. Setup enviroment
```
cd InfantAgent
conda create --name infant python=3.11
conda activate infant
conda install -c conda-forge uv
uv pip install -e .
```

2. Pull the Docker. Only required on the first use. It will pull the docker image from the Docker Hub.
```
docker pull bin12345/ubuntu-gnome-nomachine:22.04
```

3. (Optional) Config the config.toml file. If `Claude-3.7-Sonnet` is the default model.

4. Run
```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='Your LLM API Key'
python infant/main.py
```

NOTE: When you start the Docker container for the first time, it takes a bit of time to install the NVIDIA driver. As long as the container still exists, you wonâ€™t need to install it again on subsequent runs.
