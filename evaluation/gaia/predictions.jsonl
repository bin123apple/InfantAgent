Calculate the distance between the first and second atoms as they are listed in the PDB file. Report the answer in Angstroms, rounded to the nearest picometer.\n**Task**\nTHOUGHT: I'll help you parse the PDB file and calculate the distance between the first and second atoms. Let's first examine the PDB file that was attached.\nTASK:\nView the file /workspace/7dd30055-0198-452e-8c25-f73dbe27dcb8.pdb\n\n**Classification**\n1. file_view\n\nEXECUTION RESULT:\n(exit code=0)\n[File: /workspace/7dd30055-0198-452e-8c25-f73dbe27dcb8.pdb (35769 lines total)]\r\n1|HEADER    SIGNALING PROTEIN                       28-JUN-17   5WB7              \r\n2|TITLE     CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR             \r\n3|TITLE    2 EXTRACELLULAR REGION IN COMPLEX WITH EPIREGULIN                      \r\n4|COMPND    MOL_ID: 1;

Looking at the papers from both June 2022 and August 11, 2016:\n\n1. From the June 2022 paper \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\", we identified three axes in Figure 1:\n   - Standardized vs. Localized\n   - Utilitarian vs. Egalitarian\n   - Consequential vs. Deontological\n\n2. From the August 11, 2016 Physics and Society paper \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\", we can see that \"egalitarian\" is used to describe a type of society.\n\nTherefore, \"egalitarian\" is the word from the three axes in the 2022 paper that is also used to describe a type of society in the 2016 Physics and Society paper.\n\n**Finish**\nTHOUGHT: Based on our research, I can now answer the original question.\n\nThe paper about AI regulation submitted to arXiv in June 2022 (\"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\") shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends. These axes are:\n1. Standardized vs. Localized\n2. Utilitarian vs. Egalitarian\n3. Consequential vs. Deontological\n\nWhen checking which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv on August 11, 2016, we found the paper \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints.\"\n\nThe word \"egalitarian\" from the 2022 paper's axes is used to describe a type of society in the 2016 Physics and Society paper. The paper specifically discusses the transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies and analyzes egalitarian societies as a key concept throughout the text.\n\nTherefore, \"egalitarian\" is the answer to the question.\n\n**User Request**\nCONTENT: Please summarize your answer with the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]. YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.\n**Finish**\nTHOUGHT: Based on our research, I can provide the final answer in the requested format.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: egalitarian\n"}
